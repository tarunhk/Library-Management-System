# 📚 Library Management System (Java OOP)

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Command-Line based Library Management System** developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
The system allows users to view books, issue books, and return books using a menu-driven interface.

The project demonstrates how multiple classes work together to manage library operations.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to:

- Implement Object-Oriented Programming concepts  
- Create multiple classes (Book, User, Library, Main)  
- Store book records using ArrayList  
- Implement book issue and return functionality  
- Build a menu-driven console application

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17 or above)  
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA  
- Terminal / Command Prompt  
- Git & GitHub
